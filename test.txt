Code in C++.
- Description
Given a sequence of integers a1, a2, . . ., an. Perform a sequence of Q queries q(i,j) that returns the sum of ai, ai+1, . . ., aj.

- Input
Line 1: contains a positive integer n (2 <= n <= 100000)
Line 2: contains a1, a2, ..., an. (1 <= ai <= 1000)
Line 3: contains a positive integer Q (1 <= Q <= 100000)
Line 3 + k (k = 1, 2, ..., Q): contains 2 positive integers i and j (1 <= i < j <= n) of the kth query
 
- Output
Write in each line, the result of the corresponding query read from the input
